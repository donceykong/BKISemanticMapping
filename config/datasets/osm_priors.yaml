# OSM-to-Semantic-Class Mapping Configuration
# Maps OSM geometry types to Semantic KITTI class IDs for likelihood adjustment.
# When a voxel has an OSM prior (e.g., osm_building=0.8), the likelihood of the matching
# semantic class(es) is increased, and other classes are decreased proportionally.
#
# Format: Each OSM type maps to a list of semantic class IDs (as strings, then parsed to int).
# Example: osm_buildings: ["50"] means Semantic KITTI class 50 (building) gets boosted when osm_building prior > 0.
